      <description>Abstract With the interest in the time(month) and location effect on the number of deaths, this paper analyses the Death Registry Statistics from Toronto Data sets datastore, and mainly analyses the documented numbers of deaths by Registry Services staff located in four of the civic centres including Scarborough, North York, Toronto and Etobicoke. Through the numerical and vitual analysis, there tend to be more deaths on average in Scarborough and more average deaths in January.</description>
